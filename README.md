### ***Task 1 : Get familiar with docker with documentation.***

#### **What is Docker?**
=> Docker is an open-source containerization platform that helps you package your application will all its dependencies into a single unit called a container. This container can run on any system that has docker installed - local computer , company server or a cloud provider like AWS , Asure etc.

#### **Core Concept of Docker**

##### **1. Docker Image.**
=> An image is a read-only template with instruction for creating a Docker Container.
Docker Image includes:
Code
Runtime
System tools
libraries
and setting needed to run your application.

##### 2. Docker Container
=> Docker Container is instance of a docker image. Container is a lighweight and portable environment where run the actual application. 

##### 3. Dockerfile
=> Dockerfile is a text file that contain a step-by-step instruction for creating a docker image. Use `docker build` to create the image from it. [more about dockerfile.](http://https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/ "more about dockerfile")

##### 4. Docker Engine
=> It is the core part of Docker â€” includes Docker Daemon, CLI, and REST API.

##### 5. Docker Daemon(dockerd)
=> Docker Daemon is a background service that manages a container and images. and listen docker API requests.

##### 6. Docker CLI(docker command)
=> It is a docker Command-line interface to  communicate with Docker Daemon.

##### 7. Docker Hub
=> A public registry where pull or push a docker images.

##### 8. Volumes
=> Volumes in docker used for a persistence of data means if container delete but data persist in a docker volumes.

##### 9. Networks
=> Docker Networks allow containers to communicate with each others.
